`v://Siyuan` is my Siyuan Note workspace. If yours is on a different site, navigate to the corresponding drive. If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, the plugin will automatically create it on first launch and add two dynamic webpage wallpapers: `space` and `stars`.

## Images & Videos

Supports most formats; simply place them in this folder.

## Dynamic Webpage Wallpapers

Must be placed in subfolders. The subfolder name will be recognized as the wallpaper name, and `index.html` within it will be loaded as the main content.

# Compatibility

## Supported Themes

The following themes have been tested and verified to be compatible:

1. Default Theme
2. pink-room
3. Dark+
4. vert

## Other Themes

The wallpaper implementation works by adding a canvas layer at the bottom of the page to display wallpapers. If your theme prevents the wallpaper from showing, use **Developer Tools** to identify elements overlaying the canvas layer. Add corresponding CSS code to your **Code Snippet** configuration to fix compatibility issues.

For example, when using the **Savor** theme, add and enable this code in your **Code Snippet**:
```
#toolbar + .fn__flex {
    background-color: transparent;
}
```
